In this tutorial, you will use the sinch_sms gem to send an sms with Sinch. For pricing information about our [SMS API](https://www.sinch.com/sms-api/) by destination, visit [www.sinch.com/pricing/sms-prices](http://www.sinch.com/pricing/sms-prices/)

##Set up

1. Create a Sinch developer account at [sinch.com/signup](http://www.sinch.com/dashboard/#/signup)
2. In your developer dashboard, click **Apps** in the left menu
3. Click **create new app**
4. Name your app, and click **create**
5. Take note of your app key and secret, you will need them in a few minutes
6. Install the gem using `gem install sinch_sms`

##Send an SMS via the API

To require the gem, use:

    require 'sinch_sms'
    
To send an SMS:

    SinchSms.send('app-key', 'app-secret', 'message', 'to-phone-number')
    
The send method returns a json with the messageId, like so:

    {
        "MessageId": 123456789
    }
    
You can use this result to check the status of this message like so:

    SinchSms.status('app-key', 'app-secret', '123456789')
    
Checking the status of a message will return one of four values:

- Unknown - The status if the provided message id is not known
- Pending - The message is in the process of being delivered
- Successful - The message has been delivered to the recipient
- Faulted - The message has not been delivered, this can be due to an invalid number for instance.
